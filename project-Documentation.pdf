Project Documentation: Scalable Microservices-Based Banking Application
Company: JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Project Duration: January 2023 â€“ Present
Project Objective: The goal of this project is to develop and deploy a scalable microservices-based
banking application to improve transaction efficiency, enhance security, and optimize system
performance. The project involves migrating from a monolithic architecture to microservices,
implementing secure authentication, optimizing databases, and automating CI/CD pipelines for faster
and reliable deployments. The system aims to provide seamless banking operations, real-time data
synchronization, and high availability to meet the demands of millions of users.
Project Overview
This project focuses on transforming the banking application by leveraging microservices, cloud
technologies, and DevOps automation. The transition from a monolithic system to a cloud-native
microservices architecture ensures better scalability, performance, and security compliance. The
implementation of containerization, authentication mechanisms, and database optimizations has
significantly enhanced transaction processing efficiency and user experience.
Key Areas of Focus:
Microservices architecture using Spring Boot for modular and scalable development.
Cloud migration to AWS, improving system reliability and deployment efficiency.
Enhanced security with OAuth 2.0 and JWT authentication for secure access control.
Database optimization using PostgreSQL and MongoDB to improve query execution times.
Automation of CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Terraform, reducing deployment
time.
Development of RESTful and GraphQL APIs to enhance financial services integration.
Front-end optimization using React.js and Angular for a seamless user experience.
Implementation of load balancing and failover strategies to ensure high availability.
Real-time monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and AWS CloudWatch.
